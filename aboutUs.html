    <!--Adds the content for the history of the Yggdrasil-->
    <p class="center">During this time and age, forests were dwindling, and the air in cities grew heavy. Justin Llaguno, a brilliant young boy, saw all of this happening and realized he needed to find a solution to help the world survive another day. Determined, he explored nature and eventually came across a tree that sparked his curiosity. “What is the importance of trees? ” he wondered. His research revealed that trees were not only oxygen providers but also the backbone of healthy ecosystems. He came to believe that nature does not simply create trees; rather, trees are what make nature thrive. Inspired by the concept of the World Tree, Justin held onto the name, planning to use it when he eventually founded his own advocacy group.
</p>
    <p class="center">To him, Yggdrasil, the Norse Tree of Life, became a powerful symbol. It represented the idea that life itself depends on trees and that the world is held together by their existence. “We would not have life if we didn’t have trees,” Llaguno often said, using his words to inspire others to take action for life on land. With this vision, he established an advocacy group named Yggdrasil, dedicated to protecting and restoring forests. More than just a name, it became a call to action not only for Llaguno but for the entire world to recognize the importance of trees and work together to create a better future.

    <h2>Founder of the Yggdrasil</h2>
    <p>Justin Llaguno is a young boy who founded the Yggdrasil Advocacy Group. Before that, he was a member of the Junior Environment Movement (JEM Club). Gifted in biology, earth science, and physics, Llaguno understands the challenges our planet faces and refuses to stand by while humanity destroys the forests that once birthed them. Known for his determination and quick mind, he often completed in just a few hours what might take others days. Driven by his vision, he created this website to inspire people to change their ways and care for the environment and to remind us all that the future of the Earth depends on the choices we make today.
